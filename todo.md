# TODO
- update with "Actual vs. Expected Latino Turnout by County Presidential Election 2020 Source: Equis modeling using Catalist & Census data", bigger box, location top left and font 
- make legend horizontal with the text "below expectation", "at expectation", "above expectation"
- Third line in the tooltip, remove the word "CVAP" and the number itself can be converted to percentage.
- Number in the fourth line could be also converted to %.
- Franklin Gothic (medium and bold for the titles, book or condensed for the subtitles)
- Boundaries of the counties be a solid, superthin line, either white or light grey?
- Search box be below or closer to the title, and have a label to make it obvious that it is a searchbox?
- Add the state boundaries, maybe as a super thin darker line, maybe overlaying another shape file on top but with "empty" colors.
